<h1>What's This?</h1>
<p>To ease your way into using the $R{productClient}, we have authored a series of <b>Interactive Guides</b>. These
    guides will help you quickly get up and running with $R{product}.</p>
<p>We call these guides "interactive" because the Guide window tracks what you do with the client, and tells you what to
    do next. Think of it as a personal coach watching over your shoulder as you get up to speed with $R{product}. It's
    just read-and-click, all the way through.</p>

<h1>Showing The Tutorial Window</h1>
<p>Some of the guides require you to restart the client. To show the guide window after starting the client, click <b>Help</b>
    > <b>Open Interactive Guide</b>.</p>


<h1>Let's Get Started Already!</h1>
<p>$R{product} is an easy-to-use system, but it's quite robust, too. There are several simple operations you have to do
    to get up and running. We've broken these into separate tutorials, which you should perform in-sequence. To start a
    tutorial, just click its link. </p>
