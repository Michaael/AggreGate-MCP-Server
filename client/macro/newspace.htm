<p>Now that you can see this window, please <b>close the $R{aggregateClient}.</b> Note: You can also <b>print this tutorial</b>. It might be easier to follow it using a piece of paper.</p>
<p>You're now going to pretend you're a regular user, not a system administrator. This part will show you how a regular user can connect to a <b>$R{aggregateServer}</b> using <b>AggreGate Client</b> and a server account previously configured by an Administrator (remember what you did in the previous tutorial? We hope you kept the username and password for that account in a safe place...).</p>

<p>So now, let's say you're User Guy. Follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Run the <b>$R{aggregateClient}</b>.</li>
	<li>Enter a username in the <B>User Name</b> textbox. This can be any username -- doesn't have to match the username of the account you have created on the server. This will create a new <b>workspace</b> on the local Client installation. It doesn't log you in to any server just yet.<br>
  <img src="img\newuser\interim\ag_client_logon.jpg"/><br></li>
	<li>Enter a password in the <b>Password</b> textbox. You're now selecting a new password --  you didn't configure it yet. This will be the password for this user on this particular Client installation. Once you selected it, remember it or write it down somewhere. It lets you access this local workspace. This doesn't have to be the same password used for this user's account on the Server (the password you configured before, as an Administrator). It can be different.</li>
	<li>You should now get a dialog alerting you that the workspace does not exist:<br>
	<img src="img\newuser\interim\ag_dlg_newworkspace.jpg"/><br></li>
	<li>Click <b>Yes</b> to create a new workspace.</li>
	<li><b>Voila!</b> Here's your new workspace. Notice the empty System Tree -- no Server connections just yet.<br>
  <img src="img\newuser\interim\ag_client_emptyworkspace.jpg"/>
  <br></li>
</ul>

<p>It is now time to create a new Server Account -- connect to your $R{aggregateServer} again, only this time as a regular user (not an Administrator).</p>

<p>To do this, click <b>Help > Open Interactive Guide</b> and work through the tutorial called <b>Create a new Server Account</b>.</p>

<p>You've done this tutorial before, for another workspace, as an Administrator. Now you should do it from the viewpoint of a regular user, and use the credentials you have previously created for a regular user.</p>

<p><b>NOTE: Remember to use the user name and password you created for the USER, <i>not</i> the administrator.</b></p>

<p>You can close this window now, and proceed with the <b>Create a new Server Account</b> interactive tutorial.</p>
